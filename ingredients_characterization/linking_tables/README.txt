This folder contains tables to link Open Food Facts ingredients to nutritional and environmental impact databases (CIQUAL and FCEN for nutrition and Agribalyse for impact). The matches are not always perfect. The matches between OFF and the nutritional databases are only based on carbohydrates, sugars, fats, saturated fats, proteins, fibers and water, not on vitamins or other micronutrients. The matches between OFF and Agribalyse are based on environmental impact. As a consequence they may not be consistent from the nutritional point of view.
