Testing
#######

Automated tests have been written to test this project with `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org>`_. Some very simple tests are witten as doctests in the functions docstrings while the others are stored in the ``/tests/`` folder.

``/test/test_data.py`` contains a dummy product that can be used in tests to avoid recreating a product each time it is necessary.
